Funny thing is I don‚Äôt measureüòÇüòÇ I‚Äôll do my best...
I start with a whole organic chicken...I take off most of the skin, because I don‚Äôt like it fatty. In a 10-12 quart pot, cover the chicken with water and boil it until it is fully cooked through (basically chicken soup). Remove the chicken, and set it aside. At this point I add more water, because I like to make a full pot of soup. If you‚Äôre familiar with Better Than Bullion‚ô•Ô∏èI add several tablespoons of the organic roasted chicken flavor to the broth. You can always add more, so start with less, and add more to your liking. I like it rich and flavorful. Then you‚Äôll add your rice. I use Lundberg Family Farms Organic Jasmine white rice. Cook for about 20 minutes until tender. 2 cups of rice for a 10 quart pot of soup is usually good.

While the rice is cooking, I use 2 similar size silver bowls. One for eggs-8 at room temperature and one for lemon juice (I use Lakewood Pure Organic Lemon Juice)....I put almost equal parts (egg and lemon), but some find it too lemony that way, so I typically put a tad bit less lemon than egg... you can always add more lemon after to your own bowl of soup.
Once the rice is cooked, turn off the soup. The chicken that you set aside should be cooled off a bit. I usually put the dark meat back into the broth to cook with the rice, but again, depending on preference, you can just serve the chicken on the side for those who like to add dark meat or white meat to their bowls.(make chicken salad with the white meat üòä)

### Tempering the eggs and lemon:

1. whisk the eggs
2. add lemon juice to eggs-mix
3. with one hand you‚Äôll whisk the the egg lemon mixture, and with the other, you‚Äôll add the broth using a ladle. You‚Äôll have to whisk briskly, while you continue ladling the broth into the mixture until the egg lemon mixture reaches the same temperature as the soup... usually 6,7 or eight ladles full....

Note the final step is to add that mixture to the pot of soup.
Soup must be off so as not to curdle and turn into egg drop soup.
My recipe is more of a Greek Cypriot recipe. They never use orzo and rarely add carrots and celery, but you certainly can.
