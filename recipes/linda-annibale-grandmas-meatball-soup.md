# Grandma's Meatball Soup

## Linda Annibale

- 1/2 chicken (skin removed)
- Carrots, sliced
- Celery, sliced
- Onion, chopped
- Parsley
- 3 8 oz. can chicken stock
- Pepper
- Acini de pepe macaroni
- 1/2 lb. chopped sirloin
- Onion Powder to Taste
- Grated Parmesan Cheese

Place chicken in 1 quart of water, boil until tender, approx. 45 minutes. Prepare carrots, celery, and onion. Remove chicken from pot, let cool from handling. Run stock from pot through a strainer, return to pot, add canned chicken stock. Make meatballs by mixing chopped sirloin, onion powder, parsley, and grated together, form small meatballs, larger than marbles. Bring stock back to a boil, let boil until the meatballs have been added. Lower to a simmer. Add carrots, celery, onions, and parsley. Cook approximately 1/2 and hour to 45 minutes. Remove chicken from the bones, cut or shred into pieces. When meatballs have become tender return chicken to stock, then add 1/2 cup acini de pepe (or more if you like a lot of macaroni in your soup). Let simmer until macaroni is tender. If more stock is needed, add an additional can. Serve with parmesan cheese and crusty Italian bread.

This is great for dinner on a cold winter night. It sticks to your ribs and warms your bones.
