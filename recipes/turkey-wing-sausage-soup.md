# Dirty Chick Turkey Rice Stoup (Turkey Wing, Turkey Sausage, and Rice Soup)

## Kikibo Harris

Season a fresh turkey wing and drop in to a large pot with a whole peeled/ rinsed off onion. Toss in a couple of bay leaves. Add poultry seasoning. And any other seasoning that tickles your fancy. Cover with water, at least 2 quarts.

Cover the pot once it boils,.turn it down so it just simmers and cooks slowly, creating real turkey broth (I was kind of disappointed there was no wing tip. I'd have boiled.that and slow baked the rest of the wing).

I used a cheesecloth pouch for fresh rosemary in the turkey wing pot.

In another pot, the same size, fry a package of sausage links, and let them brown. I used chicken sausage, since I don't eat pork. Also I seasoned fresh ground turkey like sausage (used fresh herbs, finely chopped,& sun-dried tomatoes), made little "meat"balls and fried it as well.

Put aside in a bowl to cool.

Take the pot you fried the sausage in and add a quart of Trader Joe's tomato soup, and a quart of broth (flavor your choice). Toss in a small jar of pesto. Mix. Allow to boil, then turn down to simmer. Toss in a cup of uncooked rice.

Turn off the pot with the boiling turkey wing.

Take turkey wing and transfer to the seasoned pot. Pour in the broth it was creating.

Add cheesecloth\* pouch of fresh herbs and another cheesecloth pouch of tiny sweet peppers at this time. These go on top.

Let it simmer for a few hours until YOU think it's done.

Squeeze a lemon and remove seeds.

Pour lemon juice in at the end. Stir. I think mine cooked.a.total of 3 hours, maybe 3.5.

\*Cheesecloth pouch optional (I dislike twigs while eating)

There's poultry seasoning, turmeric, black pepper, cumin, and a couple of non salt seasoning blends.

Bon appetit!
