# Marinara and Meat Sauce

## Michael Sole

If you want to make a meat sauce take this out: 4oz of pignoli nuts
1 small bottle of capers
1 can of black olives

Make your meatballs and put it into the sauce

> Marinara just means "without meat" and there are many ways to make a marinara sauce.

- 2 cans plum whole tomatoes in basil
- 1 can paste
- Garlic
- Salt
- Pepper
- 4oz of pignoli nuts
- 1 small bottle of capers
- 1 can of black olives

Blend the tomatoes, and paste add one can of water (from the tomatoes)

Simmer the tomato slurry, put the pignoli into a pan and toast SLOWLY

Chop the olives, rinse the capers

Add everything to the sauce, simmer for 3 hours on low

The meat version:

- 2 cans plum whole tomatoes in basil (imported and yes CANNED is the right way)
- 1 can paste
- Olive oil
- 3 garlic cloves diced fine
- Garlic powder
- Salt
- Pepper
- 1lb of meatloaf mix (pork, beef, veal or 80/20 chuck)
- 1 cup bread crumbs
- 1 cup parmesian cheesse
- 1 egg

Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees

## Meatballs

In large bowl combine meat, bread crumbs, cheese and egg. Add garlic powder, salt and pepper to taste

Form meat into a meatloaf shaped loaf. Split in half, split half in half and one last time split half in half, this will be the perfect size meatball. Do this for the rest of the meat and put it in an ungreased baking dish. Bake for 30 minutes.

Heat up a few table spoons in a small pan add the diced garlic, heat for a few minutes, watch closely do not let it burn, turn off heat and let sit

Blend the tomatoes, and paste add one can of water (from the tomatoes)

Bring tomato slurry to a boil, turn down to a very low simmer
add garlic powder, salt and powder to taste

Add oil garlic mixture to the sauce
add meatballs to the sauce

Cook low and slow until the sauce thickens (anywhere from 1-4 hours depending on heat and weather)

The marinara is really good, serve it with lamb chops over linguine, the meat sauce is also awesome.
